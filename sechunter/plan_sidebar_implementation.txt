Sidebar Component Enhancement Plan

Information Gathered:
- Current sidebar.component.ts defines a basic menu with modules (dashboard, vi, cti, asm, soar, profile) with icons and role-based visibility.
- sidebar.component.html renders a vertical nav with menu items, user info, and logout button.
- sidebar.component.scss styles the sidebar with neon cyberpunk theme, smooth color transitions, and hover/active states.
- No existing submenus, badges, instance manager, favorites, or history timeline.
- No advanced UI trends like tactile feedback or focus mode implemented.

Plan:

1. sidebar.component.ts
- Extend MenuItem interface to support submenus and notification badges.
- Add data structures for:
  - Modules menu with 3D/isometric icons (use SVG or icon font).
  - Contextual submenus for each module.
  - Notification badges for menu items.
  - Instance Manager: dynamic list of client environments with status indicators.
  - Add Instance button logic.
  - Favorites/Quick Widgets: data structure for pinned widgets.
  - Action History: timeline data structure for recent operations.
- Implement logic for:
  - Showing/hiding submenus.
  - Handling drag-and-drop for favorites.
  - Managing focus mode (auto-collapse on inactivity).
  - Tactile feedback effects on hover.

2. sidebar.component.html
- Update template to:
  - Render modules menu with 3D/isometric icons.
  - Render contextual submenus under each module.
  - Show notification badges on menu items.
  - Add Instance Manager section with dynamic environment list and status indicators.
  - Add "Add Instance" button with holographic "+" icon.
  - Add Favorites/Quick Widgets area with drag-and-drop support.
  - Add Action History timeline with recent operations.
  - Add UI transitions and tactile feedback effects.
  - Implement focus mode UI changes (collapsed sidebar).

3. sidebar.component.scss
- Add styles for:
  - 3D/isometric icons and holographic "+" icon.
  - Notification badges.
  - Instance Manager environment list and status indicators.
  - Favorites/Quick Widgets drag-and-drop area.
  - Action History timeline with visual timeline.
  - Smooth transitions for menu deployment and state changes.
  - Tactile feedback (magnetic hover effect).
  - Focus mode styles (collapsed sidebar, animations).

Dependent Files to be Edited:
- Possibly services for fetching dynamic data (client environments, notifications, history).
- Possibly shared components for widgets or timeline visualization.
- Possibly add new SVG/icon assets for 3D/isometric icons and holographic "+" icon.

Follow-up Steps:
- Implement the above changes incrementally.
- Test UI responsiveness, animations, and interactions.
- Verify role-based access and dynamic data updates.
- Add unit and integration tests as needed.

Please confirm if you approve this detailed plan or if you want me to adjust or add anything.
